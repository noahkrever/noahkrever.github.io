Hello! I'm currently a researcher at the Columbia University [IEOR Department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/ieor-research) and a Data Scientist at [Roc360](https://roc360.com/). My research interests span algorithmic game theory, online learning, algorithms under uncertainty, and strategic reasoning more broadly. I enjoy applying game-theoretic AI and optimization to solving socially-inspired, real-world challenges. I'm very fortunate to do research with [Prof. Christian Kroer](https://www.columbia.edu/~ck2945/) and [Prof. Lily Xu](https://lily-x.github.io/). 

Previously, I graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in Data Science (CS + Statistics), and a concentration in Mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to research with the Theoretical High Energy Astrophysics Group [(THEA)](https://thea.astro.columbia.edu/) under [Prof. Zoltan Haiman](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/haiman-group/) studying false periodicities in quasar time-domain surveys.

I am currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science and Operations Research for Fall 2026. Please see my CV above, and feel free to get in touch about graduate school programs, research and collaboration, or anything at all!
