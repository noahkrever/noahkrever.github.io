Hello! I'm currently a researcher at the Columbia University [IEOR Department](https://ieor.columbia.edu/ieor-research) and a Data Scientist at [Roc360](https://roc360.com/). My research interests span algorithmic game theory, online learning, algorithms under uncertainty, and learning theory more broadly, as well as game-theoretic AI and optimization applications to solving real-world challenges. Generally, I'm very interested in modeling strategic reasoning and decision-making, specifically in capturing as much realism in adversarial settings as possible. I'm very fortunate to do research with [Prof. Christian Kroer]() and [Prof. Lily Xu](). 

Previously, I graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in Data Science (CS + Statistics), and a concentration in Mathematics. During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to research with the Theoretical High Energy Astrophysics Group [(THEA)]() under [Prof. Zoltan Haiman]() studying false periodicities in quasar time-domain surveys.

I am currently applying to PhD programs in Computer Science and Operations Research for Fall 2026. Please see my CV above, and feel free to get in touch about graduate school programs, research and collaboration, or anything at all!
